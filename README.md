[Ludum Dare #28 Entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=12191)

A simple web game inspired by flash chain reaction games and the pacifism mode of Geometry Wars 2. Please use Chrome to play on desktop; the game is untested in all other browsers, and known broken in some of them. You can also play on mobile (tested on iOS devices), where it works pretty well on recent devices (very well on iPhone 5S, playable but a little stuttery on iPad 2).
